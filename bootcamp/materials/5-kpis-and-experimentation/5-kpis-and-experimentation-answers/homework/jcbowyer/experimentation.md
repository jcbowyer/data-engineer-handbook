# Homework Assignment: DataExpert.io - Data Engineering Bootcamp

## User Journey
I first discovered DataExpert.io through a YouTube video that I came across randomly while searching for data engineering tutorials. The video was by Zach, and his clear and practical approach to teaching immediately stood out to me. Intrigued, I started following his YouTube channel and found more of his content incredibly insightful. Over time, I began to follow him more closely, especially when he announced a free bootcamp. That event became a turning point, as it provided a glimpse into the structure and value of his teaching style. After experiencing the free bootcamp, I was confident that the full DataExpert.io bootcamp would be an invaluable resource, and it has been. The hands-on labs, mentor feedback, and the supportive community have been instrumental in my learning journey, and I continue to refer back to the resources even now in my professional work.

## Three Experiments to Improve the Experience

### Experiment 1: Providing Slides to Accompany All Presentations
- **Test Cells & Conditions**:  
  - **Control Group (A)**: Participants access the course with only video and code-based materials.  
  - **Test Group (B)**: Participants are provided with downloadable slides summarizing the key takeaways from every presentation.  
- **Hypothesis**:  
  Providing slides will improve comprehension and allow participants to revisit key concepts without rewatching videos.  
- **Metrics Impacted**:  
  - **Leading Metrics**: Increased engagement with slides, higher slide download rates.  
  - **Lagging Metrics**: Higher quiz scores, increased course completion rates, and more positive feedback in surveys.
